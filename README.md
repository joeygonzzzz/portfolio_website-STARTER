## Personal Portfolio

![Portfolio Website](https://i.ibb.co/WgPMpts/image.png)

This was the first portfolio site I made but never deployed.

This was built using node.js which is a language I didn't know anything about since I was focusing on front end languages. I was surprised by how similar it was to react, to me it felt almost the same. While this was a fun project and I enjoyed learning another language, I assumed I should hold on deploying since I wasn't extremely comfortable with node yet. This was some more personal information in it then my current portfolio so hope you enjoy reading a little more about me!
